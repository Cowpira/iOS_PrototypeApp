# iOS_PrototypeApp

This prototype was developed for a project required by Professor Chung in my SE Project Management class at UTD in Fall of 2024.

## Project Instruction
Design a mobile app to help blind people to navigate at UTD dallas indors safety.

## Solution

### Blind Vision v1
My idea as you can at the Blind Vision v1, was to develop an app clean user friendly and with minimal buttons and inputs from the user. 
Not only to facilitate the navigation through the app but also taking in consideration that the main user of the app is blind.
So, I designed this first version to solve the problem as fast as possible.

### Blind Vision v2
After going over the requirements. I reviewed the Blind Vision v1 and realized that the app was well design and indeaded solve the problem.
But one very important thing was missing that lead me to a complete redesigned taking in considerations navigation from point A to B, safety, 
and feedback in case the user need. That is how the prototype become complete redesign from v1.

## Note:
For a better undestand download both version and start looking at v1 than see v2 so you can see and understand why all the changes were made.

## Tool
This prototypes was developed on Figma.
